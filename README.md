# Form Validation ✅

This repository contains a **Form Validation** project, created as part of my training. The goal of this exercise was to create a form with validation rules and provide real-time feedback to the user.

## Overview 📋

This project focuses on creating a registration form with input validation for fields like username, email, and password. The form provides instant feedback for errors or success and logs the submitted data to the console upon successful validation.

## Why This Project? 🤔

This exercise allowed me to practice and enhance my skills in:

- **JavaScript DOM manipulation** for real-time validation feedback.
- **Form validation logic**, including:
  - Regex for email validation.
  - Handling success and error states dynamically.
- Structuring HTML and CSS for better reusability and clarity.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Project Structure 📂

The repository contains:

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file with the structure for the form.
- **`style.css`**: The CSS file for styling the form inputs and messages.
- **`app.js`**: JavaScript code handling the form validation logic.
